# Week 1 - Introduction to Data Engineering

## Key Topics
- Introduction to Data Engineering concepts
- Overview of the course structure
- Setting up the local development environment
- Using Docker for containerized workflows
- Introduction to PostgreSQL and pgAdmin
- Loading and querying data in PostgreSQL
- Working with NYC Taxi dataset
- Writing simple SQL queries for data exploration

## Summary
In Week 1, we covered the fundamentals of Data Engineering, including setting up essential tools like Docker, PostgreSQL, and pgAdmin. We also ingested real-world data (NYC Taxi dataset) into PostgreSQL and performed basic SQL queries to explore the data. Additionally, we introduced Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and demonstrated how to provision cloud resources efficiently.
